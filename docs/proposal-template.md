# Introduction
In our modern world, where health consciousness is on the rise, the significance of nutritious eating and balanced diets cannot be overstated. Knowing how to combine ingredients to create delicious and healthy meals is a valuable skill. However, for many, the task of choosing recipes that match their ingredients can be daunting, especially for beginners. This is where recommender systems come in, simplifying the process by offering personalized suggestions based on individual preferences and dietary needs. Our project focuses on the rich landscape of Indian cuisine, renowned for its diversity of dishes crafted from local spices, herbs, and ingredients. Using advanced techniques like cosine similarity, our personalized recipe recommendation system not only enhances user satisfaction but also promotes healthier eating habits by suggesting nutritionally balanced recipes. By reducing food wastage and offering tailored meal ideas, our project benefits users and the food industry alike, fostering engagement, providing valuable insights, and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.

# Method/Approach
The methodology used in this study follows a structured approach encompassing multiple steps for the analysis and recommendation of recipes. The study starts out by importing libraries for data analysis and processing, then loading and cleaning CSV files of data. As a result, feature histograms are constructed, and then the refined data is stored for further use. To suggest food items based on ingredient identification, open-source software libraries like pandas,NumPy and mlxtend are used. Following that, an in-depth analysis of recipe ingredient popularity is done, leading to the input and output data for the recommendation algorithm. The ingredients list is converted into a transaction encoder array, and the food dish names are encoded. Both the transaction encoder and label encoder are kept for future use. On the basis of an ingredient list, a cosine similarity-based recommendation algorithm is applied to propose food dishes

# Estimated Timeline
Depending on the project's scope, resources, and complexity, different timelines might be developed. Detailed estimates of the timeline are shown below:
-	Project Planning, Data Collection and Preparation (3 weeks)
-	Recommender System Development (3 weeks)
-	Testing and Evaluation (5 weeks)


# Anticipated Problems
The development and deployment phases of a recipe recommendation system can be difficult tasks, and different difficulties may occur. Several issues with a recipe suggestion system are foreseen, including Data availability, Diverse User Preferences and Privacy Concerns in terms of collection and analysis.
