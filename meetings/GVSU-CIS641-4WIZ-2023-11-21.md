- In addition, we emphasized how teamwork and communication are critical to the project by summarizing the relationships between the classes.

## Goals for next week 
- We intend to complete the creation of the recipe recommendation system, guaranteeing that the RecommendationEngine and FilteringRecipes classes work together
